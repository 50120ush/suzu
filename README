Usage
=====

[Save (&Run Trim)]
-------------------

Fill parameters as you like and push [Save (& Run Trim)] button.

When you save data with the filename of 'TRIM.in' and you put this file in the same folder where TRIM.exe exists 
(== where SRIM is setup), a dialog window pops-up to confirm run TRIM.exe calculation with this new TRIM data.

[Load .json]
------------

Currently suzu cannot parse TRIM.in format directory, but suzu saves TRIM.in.json data with TRIM.in simultaneously.
You may load this .json file by [Load .json] button.

[Validate]
----------

[Validate] button tests a contents of widgets. This validation routine also runs before [Save (&Run Trim)] action.

.. note::

  Validation does not run automatically. The user should push
  [Validate] button explicitly to confirm the modification on GUI 
  is correct or not.

Other Buttons
-------------

[Set Example] [Dump to Console] [Clear] buttons are still remains for debugging.
